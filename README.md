# VOA Editor's Pick WordPress Theme


**Important: Do not edit style.css directly.** All CSS changes should be made to *css/style.scss* and then compiled to *style.css* by [installing SASS](http://sass-lang.com/install) and running this command from this theme's directory:

`sass --watch css/style.scss:style.css`
